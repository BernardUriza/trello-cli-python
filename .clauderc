# Claude Code Configuration for Trello CLI v2.1

This project provides a comprehensive CLI for managing Trello boards with advanced features for bulk operations, sprint planning, and query capabilities.

## Important: Always Start Here

**Before doing anything with Trello, run this command:**

```bash
trello help-json
```

This command returns a JSON object with ALL available commands, their arguments, and usage information.

## Quick Discovery Commands

1. **Get all boards:**
   ```bash
   trello boards
   ```

2. **Get board overview (structure + card counts):**
   ```bash
   trello board-overview <board_id>
   ```

3. **Get all IDs in a board (for quick reference):**
   ```bash
   trello board-ids <board_id>
   ```

4. **Search for cards across a board:**
   ```bash
   trello search-cards <board_id> "search query"
   ```

## Quick Workflow Commands (NEW!)

Move cards through workflow stages quickly:

```bash
trello quick-start <card_id>    # Move to "In Progress" + add comment
trello quick-test <card_id>     # Move to "Testing" + add comment
trello quick-done <card_id>     # Move to "Done" + add comment
```

Show cards in a board:
```bash
trello my-cards <board_id>      # Show all assigned cards
trello card-age <list_id>       # Show how long cards have been in list
```

## Sprint Planning Commands (NEW!)

Manage sprints efficiently:

```bash
trello sprint-start <board_id>     # Interactive: select cards for sprint
trello sprint-status <board_id>    # See sprint progress with visualization
trello sprint-close <board_id>     # Close sprint, move unfinished cards
trello sprint-velocity <board_id>  # Calculate team velocity
```

## Bulk Operations (NEW!)

Process multiple cards at once:

```bash
# Move cards
trello bulk-move-cards <source_list> <target_list> ["filter"]

# Add labels to multiple cards (requires file with card IDs)
trello bulk-add-label cards.txt "red" "Priority"

# Set due dates (requires file with card IDs)
trello bulk-set-due cards.txt "2025-12-01"

# Archive cards with optional filter
trello bulk-archive-cards <list_id> ["filter"]

# Create multiple cards from CSV/JSON
trello bulk-create-cards <list_id> cards.csv
```

## Board Standardization & Agile Conformity (NEW!)

Ensure boards follow Agile/Scrum best practices:

```bash
# Show available templates (agile, kanban, basic)
trello list-templates

# Standardize board lists (dry-run to preview)
trello standardize-lists <board_id> agile --dry-run
trello standardize-lists <board_id> agile

# Validate Agile/Scrum conformity
trello scrum-check <board_id>

# Migrate cards between boards
trello migrate-cards <source_list_id> <target_board_id> ["target_list"]
```

## Advanced Query Commands (NEW!)

Find and analyze cards:

```bash
# Find cards by label
trello cards-by-label <board_id> "red" ["P0"]

# Find cards due soon (default: 7 days)
trello cards-due-soon <board_id> [days]

# Find overdue cards
trello cards-overdue <board_id>

# Get list metrics (age, labels, due dates)
trello list-metrics <list_id>

# Board health check (stale cards, bottlenecks, overdue)
trello board-health <board_id>
```

## Key Features for AI Assistants

- **Discovery-first design:** Use `help-json` to understand all capabilities
- **Structured output:** Tables and formatted output for easy parsing
- **Search capabilities:** Find cards without knowing their list
- **Complete CRUD operations:** Create, read, update, delete boards, lists, and cards
- **Rich card features:** Labels, checklists, due dates, comments
- **Bulk operations:** Process multiple cards efficiently
- **Sprint planning:** Full sprint lifecycle management
- **Advanced queries:** Filter and analyze cards by various criteria
- **Quick workflows:** Shortcuts for common operations

## Documentation

- See `CLAUDE.md` for comprehensive integration guide
- See `README.md` for installation and basic usage
- All commands show help reminder after execution

## Common Workflows

### 1. Start Working on a Card
```bash
# Find the card
trello search-cards <board_id> "feature name"

# Quick start (moves to In Progress)
trello quick-start <card_id>
```

### 2. Sprint Planning
```bash
# See board health
trello board-health <board_id>

# Start sprint (interactive selection)
trello sprint-start <board_id>

# Monitor sprint progress
trello sprint-status <board_id>

# Close sprint
trello sprint-close <board_id>
```

### 3. Bulk Card Management
```bash
# Find overdue cards
trello cards-overdue <board_id>

# Create file with card IDs, then:
trello bulk-set-due card_ids.txt "2025-12-15"
trello bulk-add-label card_ids.txt "orange" "P1"
```

### 4. Board Cleanup
```bash
# Check board health
trello board-health <board_id>

# Archive old cards
trello bulk-archive-cards <list_id> "old_feature"

# Move stale cards
trello bulk-move-cards <source_list> <backlog_list>
```

Every command execution ends with a reminder: "ðŸ’¡ Run 'trello help' to see all capabilities"
